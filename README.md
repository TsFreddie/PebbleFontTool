# Pebble Font Tool

This is a set of scripts and tooling that helps generate or design fonts for PebbleOS. This tool is specifically designed for CJK fonts.

## Bold Conversion

Bold font can be generated by copying the glyph 1px to the right

This conversion can cut the design work in half by not having to worry about making dedicated BOLD variants.

## Codepoints Coverage

> PebbleOS currently works directly with codepoints with no concept of graphemes / glyphs.

For CJK codepoints specifically, this font targets specific standard documents. These documents are compiled into a giant codepoint list and use the following steps to determine which to include:

- Read [pages](./data/pages) directory for all the de-duplicated codepoints
- Remove all codepoints exceeding 16 bits
- Read [extra](./data/pages/extra) directory for additional codepoints
- Reference the [FREQUENCY](./data/FREQUENCY) file and cut the extra characters until we reach a total of 10500 characters
- Read [others](./data/pages/others) directory and add them to the final set

The current hard cap PebbleOS can hold in a single PBF file is 10922 16-bit codepoints.
We set our limit to 10500 to leave extra spaces for missing characters in other languages or special characters.
